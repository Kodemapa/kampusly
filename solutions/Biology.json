Middle lamella is the connecting link between the two adjacent plant cells. Thus, the correct answer is 'Plasmodesmata- Membranes surrounding vacuoles'.<br><\/p>",

IFN-alpha can affect tumor cell functions by multiple mechanisms. In addition, these cytokines can promote the differentiation and activity of host immune cells. Early studies in mouse tumor models showed the importance of host immune mechanisms in the generation of a long-lasting antitumor response after treatment of the animals with IFN-alpha/beta. Subsequently, an ensemble of studies based on the use of genetically modified tumor cells expressing specific IFN molecules provided important information on the host-mediated antitumor mechanisms induced by the local production of IFN-alpha. Of note, several studies have then underscored new immunomodulatory effects of IFN-alpha, including activities on T cells and dendritic cells, which may lead to IFN-induced antitumor immunity. In addition, recent reports on new immune correlates in cancer patients responding to IFN-alpha represent additional evidence on the importance of the interactions of IFN-alpha with the immune system for the generation of durable antitumor response. On the whole, this knowledge suggests the advantage of using these cytokines as adjuvants of cancer vaccines and for the in vitro generation of highly active dendritic cells to be utilized for therapeutic vaccination of cancer patients.<\/span><\/p>",

Although the reason for the blast remains unknown, it is widely believed that ever since the huge blast, the universe has been gradually and continuously expanding, and it has cooled down, leading to the formation of various atoms which have combined in different ways to form the stars and galaxies of today\u2019s universe.

Birds, reptiles, and most terrestrial arthropods, such as insects, are called uricotelic organisms because they convert toxic ammonia to uric acid or the closely related compounds guanine (guano), rather than urea.<\/p>",

Plant callus is usually derived from somatic tissues. The tissues used to initiate callus formation depends on plant species and which tissues are available for explant culture. The cells that give rise to callus and somatic embryos usually undergo rapid division or are partially undifferentiated such as meristematic tissue. Specific auxin to cytokinin ratios in plant tissue culture medium give rise to an unorganized growing and dividing the mass of callus cells. Callus cultures are often broadly classified as being either compact or friable. Friable calluses fall apart easily and can be used to generate cell suspension cultures. Callus can directly undergo direct organogenesis and/or embryogenesis where the cells will form an entirely new plant.<br><\/p>",

It gets enlarged and divides transversally into outer primary neck cell and inner central cell. The primary neck cell divides anticlinally to form two neck cells. The inner central cell enlarges and its nucleus divides into venter canal nucleus afcnd egg nucleus. Soon the venter canal nucleus disorganises.

They are one of the various plant growth regulators(PGRs). They are generally produced by the growing apices of the stems and roots; from where they migrate to the other regions of their action. Auxins can be natural or synthetic. Indole Acetic Acid(IAA) and indole butyric acid (IBA) are some natural auxins that have been isolated from plants.<\/p><p>Some synthetic auxins include NAA (naphthalene acetic acid) and 2, 4-D (2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic) which are used for various purposes.<\/p><p>Functions:<\/p><p>Physiological:<\/p><p>Cell Elongation: Auxin promotes elongation and growth of stems and roots and enlargement of fruits by overall enlargement of cells in all directions,<\/p><p>Apical Dominance: In many plants, the apical bud grows while the lower axillary buds are suppressed. This is an effect of the auxin(IAA) of the axillary bud. This can be proven but removing the apical bud which then results in the growth of lateral buds.<\/p><p>Control abscission layer: Auxin inhibits the abscission of young leaves and fruits in normal amounts. An abscission layer is produced only when the auxin content is reduced below the minimum level which ultimately leads to the fall of ripe fruits.<\/p><p>There are many other uses:<\/p><p>Rooting: Auxin stimulates root formation in woody stem cuttings.<\/p><p>Flowering: The dilute solutions of synthetic auxins are sprayed on fruits like litchi and pineapple which induce flowering in them. However, in most plants, flowering will be inhibited by spraying a high concentration of auxins.<\/p><p>Parthenocarpy: Auxins in diluted form can be used to produce parthenocarpic or seedless fruits. It has been proven that naturally parthenocarpic fruits like bananas and grapes have higher internal production of auxins.<\/p><p>Weedicides: Spraying synthetic auxins like 2,4-D is a procedure commonly used as weedicides. They are used to remove many broad-leaved weeds or dicotyledonous weeds while sparing the monocot plants.<\/p><p>Except for auxin, there are four other plant hormones called gibberellins, cytokinin, abscisic acid, and ethylene.

This process may result in oxygen depletion of the water body. One example is the \"bloom\" or great increase of phytoplankton in a water body as a response to increased levels of nutrients. Eutrophication is almost always induced by the discharge of nitrate or phosphate-containing detergents, fertilizers, or sewage into an aquatic system. Cultural eutrophication is the process that speeds up natural eutrophication because of human activity. Due to clearing of land and building of towns and cities, land runoff is accelerated and more nutrients such as phosphates and nitrate are supplied to lakes and rivers, and then to coastal estuaries and bays. Extra nutrients are also supplied by treatment plants, golf courses, and agricultural practices through the use of fertilizers. Human activities, including the ones previously listed, can be responsible for an increase in nutrients, therefore, cultural eutrophication is more pronounced in non-polar ecosystems which have higher levels of human activity.<\/p><p>So the correct option is '(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv)'.<\/p>",

Scientists are also trying to find out the physical and chemical properties and also the structure of the boron-sugar complex.

Nitrogen fixation is the step where nitrogen is converted into ammonia by the help of nitrogenase enzymes. This step can be carried out by free living nitrogen fixers such as Azotobacter or symbiotic nitrogen fixers such as Rhizobia. The ammonia generated from nitrogen fixation is first converted into nitrates by Nitrosomonas and then converted into nitrate by Nitrobacter and the process is called nitrification. After nitrification the plants take up the nitrogen from the soil and this step is known as assimilation. When the plants and animals die the organic matter decomposes leading to release of nitrogenous compounds into the soil which are then converted into ammonium by the soil bacteria, which is known as ammonification. Finally the nitrogenous compounds from the soil enter back into the atmosphere through the process of denitrification carried out by Pseudomonas and few other bacteria.<br><\/p>",

However, this theory was challenged in the late 1930s by Snow who suggested the existence of a second messenger to auxin, as auxin was not acting directly to repress branching. The use of branching mutants in pea, Arabidopsis, and rice led to the discovery of a new carotenoid-derived signal repressing branching. Genes involved in synthesis (RMS1, RMS5) as well as in response (RMS4) to this new signal have been identified and have given rise to a new model of branching control. Two independent groups have recently shown, one on pea, and the other on rice, that strigolactones correspond to this novel signal which represses branching, and to the secondary messenger in the theory of apical dominance. Strigolactones have been first identified for their role in the germination of parasitic plants like Striga or Orobanche. They also play a critical role in the widespread association between 80% of plants and fungi, the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, as they are necessary for interaction between certain plants and fungi in the rhizosphere.<\/p>",

Pumps are the proteins that use energy to transport substances across the cell membrane from a low concentration to high concentration (downhill transport).<\/p>",

The individual epithelial cells also have finger-like projections known as microvilli. The function of the villi and the microvilli is to increase the amount of surface area available for the absorption of nutrients. Each villus has a network of capillaries and fine lymphatic vessels called lacteals close to its surface. The epithelial cells of the villi transport nutrients such as carbohydrates and amino acids from the lumen of the intestine into these capillaries and lacteals (lipids). The nutrients are absorbed by processes of simple/passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, primary active transport, or secondary active transport. Among the nutrients, lipids may undergo passive or simple diffusion, short-chain fatty acids undergo simple diffusion, amino acids and glucose undergo active transport, and fructose is absorbed by facilitated diffusion. Most fats and fatty acids are actually absorbed in the lymphatic system first before being transported into the blood. Lymphatic vessels then transport the fats into the bloodstream. The absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body.&nbsp;<\/p>",

Further digestion occurs through pancreatic enzymes. Some of the partially digested protein is also absorbed through the small intestine.<\/p>",

The prefrontal cortex is in charge of abstract thinking and thought analysis, it is also responsible for regulating behavior. This includes mediating conflicting thoughts, making choices between right and wrong and predicting the probable outcomes of actions or events. This brain area also governs social control, such as suppressing emotional or sexual urges. Since the prefrontal cortex is the brain centre responsible for taking in data through the body's senses and deciding on actions, it is most strongly implicated in human qualities like consciousness, general intelligence, and personality. This vital region of the brain regulates thought in terms of both short-term and long-term decision making. It allows humans to plan ahead and create strategies, and also to adjust actions or reactions in changing situations. Since it controls intense emotions and impulses, it is sometimes referred to as the seat of good judgment.<\/p>",

Generally, growth is accompanied by metabolic processes (both anabolic and catabolic), that occur at the expense of energy. Plant growth is unique because plants retain the capacity for unlimited growth throughout their life. This ability of the plants is due to the presence of meristems at certain locations in their body. The cells of such meristems have the capacity to divide and self-perpetuate. The product, however, soon loses the capacity to divide and such cells make up the plant body. This form of growth wherein new cells are always being added to the plant body by the activity of the meristem is called the open form of growth.<\/p>",

These types of cavities are the most common types of cavities between the cells and result from the separation of cells in a tissue, especially, separation of the cell walls. The cell walls separate from each other along with more or less extended areas of the contact between the cells. Now, a question may arise that if a cavity is formed then what happens to the substances that were present there. Actually, those intercellular substances get dissolved partly, and thus an intercellular space is developed which we call a cavity. With time, this intercellular space gets bigger, and then it is known as the Schizogenous cavity. So, in simple terms, the Schizogenous cavities are comparatively bigger than the ordinary intercellular spaces.<\/p>",

Oxygen from the air enters into a leaf through stomata and reaches all the cells by the process of diffusion. This oxygen is used in respiration in cells of the leaf. The carbon dioxide produced during diffuses out from the leaf into the air through the same stomata. The photosynthesis reaction makes glucose and the respiration reaction break it down.

The fluid in which the mixture is dissolved is called the mobile phase. The fluid can be gas, solvent, and water. The mobile phase along with the mixture is fixed on a material called the stationary phase. The stationary phase can be a column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet. Each constituent of the mixture has different affinities to the stationary phase. Depending on the interactions of constituents of the mixture with its surface sites the different molecules stay longer or shorter on the stationary phase. Due to the different velocity, the constituents of the mixture get separated. The separation of the constituents of the mixture depends on the differential partitioning between the mobile and the stationary phases. Carotenoid is a type of pigment produced by plants, photosynthetic bacteria, and algae. Carotenoid pigments are bright red, yellow, or orange in color. As chlorophyll, a, and b absorbs light of the blue violet region it reflects green color. Hence, the pigments chlorophyll a and b are responsible for the green color of the leaves and other parts of the stem. Xanthophyll is a pigment that occurs in yellow green in the environment. The name xanthophyll is derived from the Greek word Xanthos and Phyllon as the yellow band was seen in the chromatography of leaf pigments.<br><\/p>",

It is specialized to perform reproduction. A flower consists of the female part called the ovary and the male part called anthers. These two organs make female and male gametes respectively.

Light between 400-700 nm wavelength constitute the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Maximum absorption of light by chlorophyll a occurs in red and blue regions of the absorption spectrum. So that, the rate of photosynthesis is maximum in red and blue light of the visible spectrum. Minimum photosynthesis takes place in the green light. Minimum absorption of chlorophyll a occurs in the green region because plants themselves are green due to the pigment Chlorophyll.<\/p>",

In such cases, seeds are liberated along with fruits. Since seeds and fruits donot have locomotory organs of their own, they have to be carried from one place to other place by certain external agencies. In some plants dispersal of fruits take place without external forces. Here the mature dehiscent fruits burst open by explosive mechanism. This mechanism of seed dispersal termed autochory is found in pea, bean, castor, cucumber, Ruellia, etc. Dry fruits of Ruellia tuberosa when come in contact with water, burst open into two halves and throw seeds to distant places, therefore the fruit is explosive.<\/p><p>Solanum nigrum reproduces mainly by seed, which are most often spread by birds and other animals that eat the fruit. Seeds of this fruit is not digested and are passed alongwith faecal matter and are thus dispersed. In Papaver somniferum as the seeds mature, the fruit dries out. Ultimately, the plant releases thousands of tiny seeds. Wind and water transport the seeds to a new location for germination the following spring. Once the seeds are released, the plant dies. In alba species seeds are dispersed by predators like squirrels and if they are not destroyed by predators, seeds can sprout quickly after falling from the tree.&nbsp;<\/p>",

The presence of these cells helps the cell to survive stress conditions. These are large, empty, and transparent cells that can store water. During sufficient water supply, Bulliform cells absorb water and become rigid due to which the leaf opens up and becomes straight (more surface area is exposed). But, insufficient water supply or stress conditions like transpiration or infection there is a loss of water due to which these cells become flaccid which makes the leaves to curl in so that less surface area of the leaves are exposed. Thus, reducing the loss of water. Once the conditions are favorable these cells again fill up themself with water and re-straighten the leaves. This mechanism is usually seen in grasses.<br><\/p>",
