Dedifferentiation is the phenomenon that leads to regaining the lost capacity of cells or tissues of plants to divide under special conditions. Differentiation is the division and growth of cells in order to attain maturity. Redifferentiation is the maturation of dedifferentiated cells thereby specializing for a particular function. Development includes all the changes undergone by a living plant from seed emergence to death.<\/p>",
