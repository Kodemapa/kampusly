One ovum is released (ovulation) during the middle of each menstrual cycle. The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when menstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days.

The entire generative cell resides within the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell. These two cells form the juvenile pollen grain or the male gametophyte. At this stage, pollens are said to be 2-celled. Later, the generative cell divides by mitosis to form two sperm cells which remain in the cytoplasm of the vegetative cell. This three-celled structure is the mature male gametophyte or pollen grain. Pollens at this stage are said to be 3-celled. In most of the angiosperms, pollen grains are released at the 2-celled stage and the generative cell divides in the pollen tube to form two male gametes, which then fuse with the egg cell and secondary nucleus. So, double fertilization occurs when the pollens are shed at 2-celled stages.<\/p>",

It is the follicular phase in which the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a fully mature Graafian follicle (due to FSH stimulation). This phase (follicular) lasts for about 14 days. The secretion of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) increases gradually during this phase and stimulates secretion of estrogen by the growing follicles. Both, LH and FSH, attain a peak level in the middle of cycle (about 14th day). This rapid secretion of LH called LH surge induces rupture of Graafian follicle and thereby the release of the ovum. This ovulatory phase is followed by the luteal phase during which the remaining follicular cells enlarge to become the corpus luteum. So, the mature Graffian follicle is present in the ovary before the ovulation i.e 11-17 days of menstrual cycle.<\/p>",

This approach utilizes RNA interference (RNAi) technology, where both sense and anti-sense RNA molecules are produced within the plant cells. These RNA molecules bind to complementary sequences in the nematode's mRNA, leading to the degradation of the target mRNA and ultimately suppressing the expression of genes essential for the nematode's survival. This mechanism confers resistance to the nematode in the transgenic tobacco plants.<\/p>",
